How do I cite Cosmos?
    Cosmos was officially published as a
    `manuscript <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/29/bioinformatics.btu385>`_,
    but has evolved a lot since it's original inception.  If you use Cosmos
    for research, please cite it's `manuscript <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/29/bioinformatics.btu385>`_.  This means a lot to the author.
