Writing Workflows
==================

.. py:module:: cosmos.graph

Cosmos has a powerful syntax for describing and construction workflows.
Workflows are stored and visualized as a :term:`DAG` who's nodes are tasks (or jobs) and who's edges are job dependencies.

Be sure to spend a lot of time with the examples, as this is often the easiest way to learn.
